# spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we'll create an ETL pipeline using the Spotify API and deploy it on AWS to extract, transform, and load music data for analysis. We'll connect to Spotifyâ€™s API to gather raw data on tracks, artists, albums, and playlists, handle API requests, and process responses to collect and store data efficiently.
